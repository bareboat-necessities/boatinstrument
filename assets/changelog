  * 0.6.0 Restructured the Box selection menu.
          For the flutter-pi install, you can now exit the instrument
            from the Setting page and the config is then copied to
            "/boot/boatinstrument.json.running" before the instrument restarts.
            "/boot/boatinstrument.config" is moved to "/etc/boatinstrument/config".
          The default configs have been updated to auto discover the signalk
            server, rather then going into demo mode.
          The row of buttons in the header bar of the Settings page now collapse
            into a menu on narrower screens.
          Updates to in-app help.
          Data handling in graphs has been simplified.
          Graphs now display the current value in 'k' if over 1000.

          Bug fixes:
            Timers are now disposed of properly.
            We now always subscribe to navigation.datetime so that that we don't
              reconnect if only static data is displayed.
            When editing Boxes, we now cope with devices that have restricted
              areas of the screen.

  * 0.4.0 Added option for enabling Experimental Boxes.
  
          We now handle notifications in a more sane way so we don't continually
          show repeat notifications. We also mute individual notifications
          rather than all or none. Muted notifications are automatically un-muted
          after a configurable number of minutes.

          On devices that have restricted areas of the screen, e.g. phones with
          notches, we now display Boxes outside these areas.

          For new installs, a basic landscape or portrait config is now included.

          Bug fixes:
            Issue when filtering paths in Custom Boxes
            Rudder Angle Box could draw out of bounds
            When scaling text, we now make sure the font size is at least readable.
